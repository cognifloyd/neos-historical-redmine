if you wanna put Inline JS into your fluid template your validation may fail if you lack the CDATA Section.

If you wanna call internal ViewHelpers in JS you cannot set CDATA manually in the template

replace  - overwrite the existing page title.  This is the default.
append - add the value to the end of the existing title
prepend - add the value to the beginning of the existing title

glue is the string to use if the value is append or prepend.

display has two potential values:
none - meaning the viewHelper renders nothing in the template.
render - means that the tag will render it's children.  This way you could use it in the context of an h1 tag like this:

Due to the fact that rtehtmlarea needs to make some modifications to the form tag (attribute ""onsubmit"") and adds some js before and beyond the form, it is necessary to modify the FormViewhelper.php (see attached patch_FormViewHelper.diff based on FormViewHelper.php in https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/CoreProjects/MVC/fluid/trunk/ Revision 2522).
With this modifications the FormViewHelper gets the needed JS for all Rte form fields from the viewHelperVariableContainer which is filled in by the RteViewHelper and adds this to the returned content.

In conjunction with extensions based an extbase / fluid the RTE produces tags with ID's which are not valid:

in usual project context, labels and strings in templates neither can be really re-used nor an abstract, generic ""variable name"" for each string can be found.
So I would suggest some kind of ""inline translation"" View Helper, it uses an appoach I used to have use of in earlier ""pibase""-projects.

It would read simply the following:

<pre>
{f:inlineTranslate(values:{def:'My translation',de:'Meine Übersetzung',fr:'Mon translation(?)'})}
</pre>

This would reduce update overhead because translations that are anyway only used once in a specific context do not have to be updated in two files (the template file where the key is used and the locallang-xml-file).


Consider the situation where the customer wants to change the intro text of the login screen from ""Please login using your credentials"" to ""Please login using your user name and password"".
With ""the old style"" you have to look at the template file, obtain the key, switch to the locallang file and correct it in each language. And maybe the change of the textual value should result in changing the key also; changing the key could result in conflicts with existing ones...


What do you think?

I just wrote a project specific view helper that could be ported; I would be honoured to find it in the core."

This ImageViewHelper can process image lists as they come from database: image1.jpg,image2.jpg

It just calls the standard ImageViewHelper for every image.

Then you can add a ImageLinkWrap config array, so you can use JSWindow.

And every image can be wrapped. 

Example:
<pre>
In Controller: 
$imageLinkWrap = array(
        'JSwindow' => 1,
        'JSwindow.' => array(
            'newWindow' => '0',
            'expand' => '17,20',
        ),
        'enable' => 1,
);
$this->view->assign('images', $item->getImages());
$this->view->assign('imageLinkWrap', $imageLinkWrap);

In Fluid Template: 
<myviewhelper:imageLinkWrap srcList=""{images}"" srcPath=""uploads/tx_myextension/"" alt="""" width=""120m"" height=""120m"" imageLinkWrap=""{imageLinkWrap}"" wrap=""<li>|</li>"" />
