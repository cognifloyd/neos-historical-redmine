As this part is somehow hacky anyways inside TemplateView, it needs to be cleaned up.

The following cases need to be tested separately:

* <f:render section=""foo"" /> in a Layout
** should render section in TEMPLATE
** should use variables of TEMPLATE
* <f:render partial=""foo"" /> (no matter where)
** should render the given partial EVERYWHERE
** arguments need to be passed explicitely
* <f:render section=""foo"" /> in a Partial
** should use section in same PARTIAL
** arguments need to be passed explicitely
* <f:render section=""foo"" /> in a Template
** should use section in same TEMPLATE
** arguments need to be passed explicitely
* <f:render partial=""foo"" section=""bla""/>

HTML5 ist kein XML. Daher kann es auch kein xmlns geben (die einzig zulässige Ausnahme ist der exakte String xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" ). In RDFa1.1 wird es für die Definition von CURIEs ein prefix-Attribut geben. Das sieht dann so aus:

<pre><html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" 
	prefix=""dc: http://purl.org/dc/terms/
	typo3: http://typo3.org/ontology/TYPO3#
	flow3: http://typo3.org/ontology/FLOW3#
	t3con11: http://t3con11-frankfurt.typo3.org/resources/""></pre>

Das versteht derzeit aber weder ein Validator noch ein RDF-Extraktor, da alle HTML5 und RDFa1.1 Spezifikationen zur Zeit nur Working-Draft-Status haben. Daher bleibt in HTML5 derzeit nur die Lösung, doch xmlns zu verwenden. Das validiert dann zwar nicht, aber Extraktoren, sollten aber mit dem Dokument dann zurecht kommen.

Die CURIE ""typo3:TYPO3:Text"" wird auf ""http://www.typo3.org/ns/2011/FLOW3/Packages/TYPO3/Content/TYPO3:Text"" projiziert wird und ist damit nicht standardkonform. Besser wäre ""typo3:Text"". Ich weiß, dass TYPO3:Text der TYPOScript-Name ist. Vielleicht lohnt es sich hier eine Vereinheitlichung zu finden, bei der der (lowercase) Package-Name als Präfix genommen und der Name (""Text"") dann groß geschrieben wird. Ich würde außerdem die Informationen über die Seite an sich in die meta-Tags schreiben. Das Endergebnis sähe dann so aus:

Ideas for direction:
# setup.php in the Web folder -> check if the TYPO3.Setup bootstrap file is available
** TYPO3.Setup is a separate package since continues deployment won't need this feature
** Check if the package TYPO3.Setup is activated?
# Run the TYPO3.Setup bootstrap
** Check for minimum requirements? Most are duplicated in the FLOW3 core bootstrap (could we combine this somehow)?
** We should have some kind of authentication (Maybe a file should be CREATED to run the setup wizard)
*** A file could be created automatically if it's the first time FLOW3 is executed (also a file somewhere) with the login information
** Check file permissions?
# If everything is okay (FLOW3 is running):
** Run the FLOW3 core bootstrap in Setup context through the already executed code and then create a request handler which mimics the web request handler, although the request builder doesn't use routing for fetching the correct setup controller
*** Authenticate with login field (FLOW3 security)
# A step setup wizard
** Steps configured in yaml
** Handle a variable number of steps
** Use form step stuff from the form project

* Call commands through the \TYPO3\FLOW3\Core\Booting\Scripts executeCommand method
* Would be nice if the setup could create the database if provided with user/pass with access for that
** http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_0/nl/connections:creating-and-dropping-database
* Steps (must be able to go back & forth)
*# Language
*# Pre-installation check (requirement meets)
*# Database setup (type, name, user, pass)
*** Advanced options (host, port)
*** Backup of old db?
*# Title, Administrator (username, password, e-mail), default language/timezone? (TYPO3 specific)
*# Import site (TYPO3 specific)

User scenarios:
* Cloud server
* Shared hosting server
* No database created (but access to create db's)
* Full access

Open questions/suggestions:
* Create a configuration tool like the v4 install tool using the same request handler for TYPO3 / FLOW3
* Create a install script suggested by Jacob Floyd, which would fetch the packages through or w/o git (if available)
** Then after this process has finished it should redirect to the setup wizard

<pre>
I've added to that google doc about the pre-setup install script (that downloads/initializes a flow3/typo3 phoenix distribution): Make the install script so that it can be automated from the command line, as well as running in the browser. CLI for more cloud environments especially corporate environments. Web install for shared hosts, and mom/pop shops.

In other words: make the installation friendly to enterprise customers as well as small businesses and even personal websites. If people can use it at home, they're more likely to learn to love it and start a ground swell of support from within the corporate environment. That's one reason WP is so popular - lots of people use it at home for personal sites, and then they recommend using WP when it comes time to build a site in their org.

I think an ideal basic installation should take about 5 minutes. That includes the initial setup wizard. So, people should be able to get a basic, mostly extension-less Typo3 Phoenix installation, running with a barebones functional website, in about 5-10 minutes. (Some fudge room could be acceptable for bandwidth considerations or download time - so, that's 5-10 minutes of active effort on the user's part.)

Make the install and setup process fast, so that the first impression of Typo3 is, ""Wow, I like this"", or ""Wow, that was fast, so my website will be fast!"" (first impressions aren't always logical... But they color your view of the product for the rest of the evaluation process)

If a plugin throws an exception, now backend interaction handles such as ""add new content element after"" or ""delete"" are available.

A simple example: Create a plugin having a default action with a required property.
Real world example: orderController::checkoutAction($order)

Having a plugin with a required property makes sense if you want to allow editors to add regular content above and below such a plugin.

Avoiding required properties in those actions destroys validation, so this is not a sollution.

I can think about three sollutions:
# Use default property when being in backend editing mode. This could be configured throug TypoScript or plugin configuration and obviousely only works for plugins that don't trigger persistence::write() operations. 
# Make plugins skippable through TypoScript when being in backend editing mode.
# Catch all kind of exceptions like it's currently done, but don't skip interaction handler wrapping.

I would vote for both sullutions, 1 and 2. And number 2 should be default for all plugins with required arguments. I'm sure there are several plugin situations that don't have required properties but fail to render propertly, too. So it's not only a problem for required arguments.

Regards,
Stephan."

After a fresh installation off Neos, it directly throws Exceptions if you switch Modules in Backend.

This is because in TYPO3.Neos/Resources/Private/Templates/Module/Widget.html, unregistered Argument ""uri"" in ViewHelper ""f:uri.resource"" is used.

Changing the Argument Name in the ViewHelper to path corrects this issue.

Before:
<pre>
<f:if condition=""{submoduleConfiguration.icon}"">
                        <img src=""{f:uri.resource(uri: submoduleConfiguration.icon)}"" class=""pull-right"" />
                </f:if>
</pre>
After/Fix:
<pre>
<f:if condition=""{submoduleConfiguration.icon}"">
                        <img src=""{f:uri.resource(path: submoduleConfiguration.icon)}"" class=""pull-right"" />
