It should be possible to skip such elements.

In the FormBuilder (rootForm.renderingOptions.previewMode == TRUE) unknown elements should be replaced by some ""MissingFormElement"" that renders some error message.
When rendering the Form it should be possible to simply skip those elements.
Possibly this could be achieved with some setting @skipUnknownFormElements@"

So if you have a element with identifier ""user.name"", @$formRuntime['user']@ will return @NULL@ instead of @array('name' => 'some default value')@

and THEN you can use your own xlf files in

a simpler approach would be nice. Maybe just introduce a setting that will be used within Field.html... something like

My idea was to decide whether to show or to hide a set of Page objects depending from e.g. checking a specific box. I tried to do this similar to the _ConditionalRequired_ _FormElement_ of the _TYPO3.FormExample_ Package, simply by doing something like 

> $this->getRootForm()->removePage($pageToDisable);

That solution works for one page-switch - if I press on next/previous at the page that I successfully skipped, I get led to the disabled one directly - that's really confusing.

Maybe there is already a way to implement it as I imagine (see the pdf as example). Maybe I have to split the form into different forms which are simply connected by finishers?
