This happens because the TYPO3.FormBuilder.Configuration.endpoints address is
used with a '/' in front as the param to window.open. When on a development installation
without a vhost, and therefore a base href with a path, the path is ignored.

Possible solution:
* make the address relative by removing the '/' in app.js:492
* let TYPO3.FormBuilder.Utility.getUri() respect the base href in the html
