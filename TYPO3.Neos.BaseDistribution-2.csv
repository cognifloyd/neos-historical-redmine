* Amount: 15 work days
* Version: *must have* for 1.0

h2. Motivation

Neos is still under massive development, and will likely stay that way. However, we want to make sure that it is usable for implementors, such that they know which parts we consider as stable.

In practice, this means that the parts of the system which we consider as stable are marked as API. This includes PHP classes, configuration settings, and TypoScript objects.


h2. Goal

Before we can release version 1.0 of Neos, we need to initially check the various components for stability and document that accordingly. Additionally, if we find naming annoyances in parts which are public API we'll rename them as needed.


h2. Deliverables

* *must have, complete*: stable configuration settings (especially node type definitions) are explained and documented in the Neos Integrator Guide
* *must have, complete*: stable TypoScript objects are documented in the Neos Integrator Guide

h3. How To Review

The change is currently under review in https://review.typo3.org/#/q/topic:44982,n,z

However, the change is quite big, so that's why I created some github repositories which
show the incremental changes which were made (to make the diff more manageable):

* https://github.com/skurfuerst/TYPO3.Neos/commits/dev-nodetyperenaming
* https://github.com/skurfuerst/TYPO3.Neos.ContentTypes/commits/dev-nodetyperenaming
* https://github.com/skurfuerst/TYPO3.TYPO3CR/commits/dev-nodetyperenaming

* For each version which has been *pushed to gerrit*, a tag has been created named *reviewX*
  (e.g. *review1*) in all of the three repositories above

* After every incremental change I did, Neos was (I think) fully functional for me. So you can easily
  check out any intermediate step by just cloning the respective versions from the GitHub repository.

* just make sure to *use the non-minified JavaScript* while testing, and if necessary clear all caches.

*HAPPY TESTING* :-)

h3. Next Steps

* There will be one more *breaking* change for 1.0, which renames *TYPO3.Neos.ContentTypes* to
  *TYPO3.Neos.NodeTypes*. but aside from that, the node type definition should be quite stable now :-)
* Furthermore, the *base node types* will still change once again (#45317)"

* Planned Implementation Timeframe: March - April 2013

h2. Motivation

Neos users need a way to organize images and files to have them reusable in content as content images or downloads. They want to preview the images they need and probably want to search in their available files.

h2. Goal

Create a basic solution for organizing files in Neos which has a simple way to upload new files and browse already uploaded files.
The solution should be usable in Neos content view as well as in Neos Backend modules and other places of the system. That means we need to extend the TYPO3.Media package and do not create dependencies on Neos in order to have this media browser usable in Flow applications as well. Images should be visible as a thumbnail gallery. Users should be able to categorize files (tagging) and search by those categories.

h2. Deliverables

* -MUST: AbstractMediaFile Model -> Image and (to be created) Document model extend that-
* -MUST: MediaFile Repository to find existing files and images-
* -MUST: Media browser (UI) to see existing files and images in the system as independent Flow application-
* -MUST: Uploads in media browser-
* -MUST: Image preview in media browser-
* -MUST: Tag Modelling and relations to files-
* MUST: documentation for users of the media browser and developers that want to use the media browser in Neos modules or Flow applications.
* -MUST: Integration to Neos content view-
* COULD: hierarchical tags
* COULD: search
* COULD: endless scrolling
* MAYBE: Metadata Model and relations"

h2. Motivation

Anyone who is about to build a website using TYPO3 Neos needs to be able to have the needed knowledge available in a nice to read documentation. The same is true for developers about to write plugins for Neos or work on the system itself.

In the past the lack of documentation for TYPO3 has always been mentioned (justified or not) as an impediment for adoption. And even those who recognized the existing documentation complain about the learning curve.

h2. Goal

To make it easy for integrators and developers to get into TYPO3 Neos it is thus needed to have documentation available that is *concise*, *easy to understand* and *available* at an early point in the product lifecycle.

What has been started at https://review.typo3.org/17510 will be used as base for this.

* Planned Implementation Timeframe: February till half-way april

h2. Motivation

People with disabilities can have huge problems using webapplications. There are specifications available like WAI-ARIA which can be used for enabling those people to use all features the Neos interface offers.
A power user is used to using keyboard shortcuts and navigation. As the WAI-ARIA specification already requires keyboard navigation the power user will have a faster editing experience.

h2. Goal

We aim for a backend, usable by all people, not limited by disabilities. It has to be compatible with assistive technology like screenreaders. By having a smooth keyboard control the content editing will also be a lot faster for power users.
Besides implementation we aim for awareness by offering guidelines and documentation how other developer can develop modules in Neos following the same principles so those will be accessible too.
In this work package we will implement the first steps needed to have an accessible backend. 

h2. Deliverables

* Add WAI-ARIA landmarks / roles for application, navigation, content and inspector
* Enable keyboard navigation trough content elements and the inspector (WAI-ARIA)
* Edit Content with Keyboard Shortcuts (general editing like copy, paste, cut, delete and create on content elements)
* *Could have* keyboard navigation in menubar and toolbar
* *Could have:* A clear help function in the for usage of this feature (like the overlay in for example gerrit or github)
* Keyboard mapping for cross-browser / OS compatibility (using a library like http://craig.is/killing/mice)
* Documentation of the feature, and documentation for other developers using / extending Neos

h2. Motivation

About ten years ago when Kasper presented the first version of the *Extension Kickstarter* that was a little sensation and resulted in a boost of contributions. Without it's extensibility and without the good old *pibase* TYPO3 would probably not be as popular as it is today.
For Neos we want to provide a solid plugin foundation right from the start.

h2. Goal

Neos already contains a *plugin TypoScript object* but the current implementation is very basic to say the least. We need to work on that in order to make it very easy for people to write plugins and/or to turn Flow packages into a Neos plugin without having to mess with the original package code.
What has been started at #40599 will be used as base for this.

h2. Deliverables

* *MUST*: Polished Backend UX (as described in #40599)
* *MUST*: ""touchless"" integration of Flow packages
** resolve links automatically
** overridable View configuration (change templates, view implementation & options without changing the original package, see #42176)
** improve Fluid link/uri ViewHelpers (#35790)
* *MUST*: stable plugin API (provide a *PluginService* that can be used everywhere in order to fetch data about certain plugins & plugin views)
* *MUST*: documentation (developer guide, integrator guide, step-by-step example)
* *MUST*: solid test coverage

h2. Motivation

A solid webservice interface provides countless possibilities. With a proper foundation it would easily be possible to expose the TYPO3 Content Repository as service for instance. This would allow other systems to interact with arbitrary nodes (e.g. mobile clients creating pages, a simple plugin creating content nodes, ...).
Another use case are custom service APIs for the clients business logic. Flow already provides basic support for that, but there are some important parts missing.

h2. Goal

The goal is to have a solid foundation to easily provide custom REST APIs. What has been started at #37604 will be used as base for this.

h2. Deliverables

* *MUST*: more flexible request handling
** Reworked argument merging #45290 - this is required in order to fix argument mapping with non-GET requests

* *MUST*: Routing improvements
** Global route constraints #27117 - this is required in order to match requests based on the request method and/or arbitrary request headers
** Nested sub routes #43966 - this is required in order to allow developers to easily include ""RESTful"" routes
* *MUST*: session-less authentication #45282 - currently Flow creates a session for every authentication, this is incompatible with REST
* *MUST*: solid test coverage

h2. Motivation

Linking to internal and external resources is a key feature of any CMS and are fundamental to the WWW. As such, providing easy to use and convenient support for linking is simply a must have.

h2. Goal

Linking to internal resources should be very easy, possibly using some link wizard / browser. Links to internal resources should never break; if targets are moved or deleted, links should adapt automatically. For links to external resources some checking would be nice to have, so dead links can be detected. Links to the site (from the outside) should be maintained as good as possible as well - if a page is moved a redirect should occur instead of a 404 - and if pages are deleted providing a proper 410 response is advisable.

h2. Deliverables

h2. Description

The team and contributor's efforts need to be coordinated with the end user and overall concept in mind in order to not end up with a patch work solution of individual components glued together. This work package is about spending a day per week for the product management and communication with those working on specific features.

Depending on how much communication and coordination is necessary, some part of the weekly day can additionally be used for related tasks, such as communicating the current state and roadmap or improving the Neos website.

h2. Goal

* establish a day per week where the project lead is available for questions regarding the feature set, possible impediments or technical decisions
* keep an eye on the consistency and overall user experience and communicate findings and possible measurements to the team
* discuss feature details through hangouts / chats / email and create feature descriptions / stories / wireframes


h2. Deliverables

* a brief summary of what happened product / feature wise, which will be included into the monthly team report
* a maintained product backlog with prioritized stories
* decisions / conclusions from meetings with individuals are communicated to the mailing list

* Planned Implementation Timeframe: March - April 2013

h2. Motivation

Neos does not, so far, provide any sort of page cache. The has been from the beginning to rely on established HTTP mechanisms instead and use cache control directives and mechanisms like Edge Side Includes instead. The advantage of this approach is to not re-invent front end caching and being able to delegate this to highly performant proxies like Varnish.

Neos should, however, be production ready as is, without the need for a reverse proxy. Therefore Flow should provide a basic reverse proxy itself and thus be able to cache responses if no Varnish is used. As a first step, Flow has been refactored in 2011 / 2012 to provide or more modular bootstrap and an HTTP foundation. What's missing now is the actual usage of cache headers in Neos and a rudimentary reverse proxy integrated into Flow (and thus used by Neos).

h2. Goal

Implement a reverse proxy for TYPO3 Flow which can basically cache HTTP responses according to the mechanisms specified in RFC 2616 and deliver them to a client if a cached response is available. The reverse proxy should also support purging / banning of single or multiple cache entries ? this mechanism can then be used by Neos for invalidating cache entries of pages which have been modified.


h2. Deliverables

* MUST: Reverse Proxy for TYPO3 Flow which can basically cache HTTP responses and return them on request
* MUST: Neos sets cache control headers / expiry times according to some global configuration
* MUST: Reverse Proxy allows for purging / banning single or multiple cache entries
* MUST: Documentation

* MAYBE: Edge Side Includes support"

This concept discusses how to do access control on nodes. It has been created by Andi Förthner, Sebastian Kurfürst, and Helmut Hummel during T3BOARD13.

h2. Security Framework in a nutshell

In this section, we quickly describe how authorization in the security framework works with *Policies*,
to again have a common basis for later.

Access is granted or denied for *Resources*, according to the following rules:

# not-explicitely-specified resources are implicitely ALLOWed.
# (roughly)if AT LEAST ONE of the current roles defines a GRANT on a resource, access is GRANTED. The full rules follow below:
## DENY always wins, so if ONE role is DENIED access, this will win.
## otherwise, if at least one role says GRANT, you are allowed to access the resource
# if a resource is explicitely defined, but none of the current roles defines an ACL on it, this defaults to DENY (""Abstain Case"")
# if multiple resources match on a given code point, ALL resources must be evaluated to ALLOW (ANDed together)

h3. Mapping to nodes

We want to apply as many as possible of the above concepts to *nodes* as well, meaning the following:

* we need to think about what a ""resource"" is for nodes
* we will use roles as usual
* we will use ACLs (== mapping between roles and resources) as usual

So we essentially need to solve the question: *What are resources on nodes, and how to define them?*

A *resource* on a set of nodes could be defined in various ways: For instance, we could explicitely enumerate the nodes
which are part of this resource. However, this is quite cumbersome, as this list would need to be manually maintained.

Instead, people often want to assign permissions based on certain properties of nodes, for example ""I want to ALLOW
creation if TEXT elements"" (here, the *node type* of the node should be matched on).

Because of that, we do *not* want to explicitely enumerate a resource based on nodes, but instead
want to *create a boolean function which decides whether a certain node is inside the resource or not*

For creating this boolean function, we want to use the *Eel language*, as it provides predefined syntax,
making it possible to focus on the semantics for us.

To sum it up: A *resource* on a set of nodes is an *Eel Expression* matching these nodes. Example:

	// Resource for all text nodes
	q(node).is('instanceof Text')

	// resource for all nodes of a site
	q(node).inSite('TYPO3.NeosDemo')

	// Resource for all nodes whose ""text"" property starts with ""hi""
	// -> a little dangerous, but nevertheless possible
	q(node).is('text ~= Hi')

	// ALLOW creation of ""Text"" child node underneath three column node
	( creation() || deletion() )
	&& q(node).is('instanceof Text')
	&& q(node).parent('insanceof ThreeColumn')


h3. Properties of the node mapping

* the whole evaluation is order independent, meaning we do not need priorities, !important or anything like that

In Flow and Neos, there are resources, there are (controller-) actions, there are nodes, and of course there is still the need to link to a typical URL like http:// and mailto:.

Especially the Resource, Action and Node links will result in a different ""output"" then their meaning representation; a Resource is a hash, resulting in the frontend-published URI; an action consists of package, controller, action, argument.. values, resulting in an URI-builder-built url.
And the node is represented by its path or identifier, resulting also in a web-accessible http url.

So, see the following examples:

* @node:///sites/exampleorg/home/welcome/some/section/with/stuff@ Could even result into http://example.org/home/welcome.html#somesectionwithstuff
* @resource:///348fb109a2098234b23498@ Would result into the frontend-published resource
* @media-resource:///348fb109a2098234b23498?width=500&height=800@ Would provide a scaled image
* @http://www.google.de/@
* @mailto:john.doe@example.org@
* @action:///acme.package?controller=sample&action=create&arguments=.....@

This is what just came in my mind and of course these are just suggestions and need to be checked
against current requirements...


h2. Basic implementation idea

For implementing kind of this, I'm thinking about a service, where various schema implementers can hook in. Neos, for example, would then bring its own NodeSchemaImplementer (?), TYPO3.Media could provide an implementor which allows also scaling an (image) resource (like IMG_RESOURCE).
Flow on it's very own of course brings an MvcActionSchemaImplementer (?) (I'm just throwing around with name suggestions which helps me to understand what I mean ;)

I think these schemas schouldn't have anything to do with the StreamWrapper because that's more an internal PHP thing. ""Our"" schema here is ""just"" a naming convention to transpose a stringly given resource locator to its actual representation.

h2. Locate TYPO3CR nodes

Since nodes can be moved around, it sounds making sense to use the node identifier. However, as far as I got it, the node identifier can be pretty ""volatile"" in regards of workspaces, etc.

But still, in order to be able to keep old ""links"" updated in case their nodes are moved around, their paths would need to be updated. This could only be done by something like a Refindex, and is likely also not very nice... What do you think on the long run?"

h2. Motivation

As soon as a project introduces a user base, including accounts (which is intrinsically the case on Neos projects due to the Administrator/Editor roles), the need for versatile management possibilities is raised.

h2. Goal

Administrators should be able to use the GUI for everything the data base provides, in a company-kind manner, that is, for example, resetting a user's or bulk-resetting a group of user's password with an auto-generated one; providing a way to set and assign roles to users; and, not at least, provide a way to add GUI implementations for concrete implementation classes (not every Account has a TYPO3.Party assigned, and not every AbstractParty has a SinglePerson).

h2. Deliverables

* MUST have a way to assign roles to users
* MUST reflect the fact that the Core only prescribes Account and AbstractParty, implementors should be able to set GUI implementations of their own Party and Person implementations
* SHOULD have a way to set an auto-generated password to the account
* SHOULD provide the possibility to bulk-reset user passwords"

*CI Setup for Selenium*

* Install Xvfb (aptitude install xvfb)
* Download init script from https://gist.github.com/jterrace/2911875 to /etc/init.d/xvfb
* chmod +x /etc/init.d/xvfb
* sudo update-rc.d xvfb defaults

* Install Firefox

* Install Selenium server into /usr/local/lib/selenium:
** Download http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.32.0.jar
* Download init script from http://www.danstraw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/selenium.txt
* Added 'export DISPLAY="":1.0""' before starting Selenium server to set the display for Xvfb

* Run Apache on 8081 (parallel to Nginx)
* Create VHost in Apache
* Install MySQL

*Ideas:*

* Post only message on failure (instead of -1)
* Start Xvfb using Jenkins Xvfb plugin (run in parallel in start / stop after tests)

* Capture video (headless gem)
** Start capturing video before each scenario"

The reasons were the following:

======================
Rules
======================

* UpperCamelCase
* Handlebars in same folder and same name as file
* View do NOT leak into global scope (REMOVE T3.*)
* we do NOT use Ember Router and the related naming conventions for content module.
* Abstract classes -> AbstractXY in terms of naming

Referencing Helper Views
------------------------

Furthermore, if a view needs another view for working (f.e. from the `shared` namespace), we explicitely
load it as dependency and then make it a property of a view. Example:

    define(
        ['Shared/MyHelperView'],
        (MyHelperView) ->

            StuffView = E.View.extend {
                # in contrast to other properties of an object, we use
                # UpperCamelCase naming conventions here to show that we
                # reference another *class*, and not an *instance*
                MyHelperView: MyHelperView
            }
    )

Inside the Handlebars template of the view, we can then reference this view using:

    {{view view.MyHelperView}}

This way, we do not need to put helpers into any global namespace.

Currently I see three different ways to configure things:
* Global configuration in Settings.yaml (across sites)
* Site specific configuration via TypoScript
* Node specific configuration #48363

The other end of this is how and what we should provide in our default template. The goal is that the implementation shouldn't overwrite the template unless absolutely necessary to make version updating as easy as possible. Add to this we should provide a clean and simple, yet ready to use and up to date html5 implementation as the default (like html5boilerplate[1] and the like).

that it is positioned at the start""; for ""end 10000"" conversely, it means
""very certain that it is positioned at the end"". If we do not specify an
priority, that defaults to ""position $somewhere in this area with low
priority"", e.g. priority 0.

When sorting keys before and after each other using ""before [otherkey]""
and ""after [otherkey]"" respectively, we express that an element should
be ""somewhere before/after"" an element. The higher the priority, the
more close it should be towards the element. Before this change, it
was exactly the other way around which was counterintuitive.

* Target Audience: *developers* who want to use Flow
* Responsible: Robert Lemke <robert (at) typo3 (dot) org>
* Implemented by: Karsten Dambekalns, Robert Lemke <robert (at) typo3 (dot) org>
* Amount: 6 work days
* Version: *must have* for Neos 1.0
* Planned Implementation Timeframe: week 25 to 26, 2013

h2. Motivation

The release of Flow 2.0 stable has been postponed for weeks now since nobody had the resources to dedicate himself for 2-3 days to tackle the remaining loose ends, create the 2.0 code release an publish the release notes. People are more and more asking for it, so it's high time to get 2.0 out of the door, especially considering that any Neos version will require Flow 2.1.

h2. Goal

Make the Flow 2.0 release happen and announce it on the Flow website / social media channels.

Go through pending patches, open critical bugs and prepare a tagged version for 2.0 stable. Rename the public git repositories (still containing FLOW3 in their name and path). Compile release notes. 

h2. Deliverables

* [MUST]
** reviewed pending patches and open critical bugs which are important for 2.0
** tagged version 2.0
** renamed git repositories (some still contain FLOW3 in their name)
** release notes
** announcement on typo3.org

* [SHOULD]
** upgraded flow.typo3.org to latest Neos (hasn't been upgraded since March)

Currently we have a concept of childNodes which are automatically generated for content. Instead we should have concept of node structure that is used for both documents and content. Instead of using TypoScript to define the structure and create it during rendering, the structure should be configured in the node type to avoid a dependency on TypoScript and prevent modification of nodes during the rendering.

This would make it possible to provide certain layouts that matches your page templates / TypoScript. And then define templates based on the layout structure with a TypoScript case matcher.

Neos should provide some common structure names like main, header, footer etc. as a convention to allow easy switching between node types / layouts.

* Creation of node structure should not be done during rendering (currently done as a hack in @DefaultContentCollectionImplementation@)
* Adjustment of node structure needs to happen when creating a node, changing the node type or updating the layout property
* The layouts feature should be implemented outside the scope of TYPO3CR as a concern of Neos
* Layouts should be configured in the NodeTypes.yaml in an extensible way (e.g. prepend package key as in TypoScript to the  name)

This should separate structure from presentation, which is for database operations etc.

We need a way to select the default layout so it can just inherit from it's parents. In addition to that it would be very useful to set the default for all children. Like in gridelements for CMS, where the layout can be chosen for the current page and for the subpages."

There is already a simple concept for this called childNodes used for the content node types, but this should be improved and streamlined for all node types.

Proposal: Add a structure configuration to node types defining the substructure of the node type. This includes different paths with configuration for the type of child node along with other things like allowed child node types, disallowed child node types, maximum child nodes and default child nodes. Additionally there should be added allowed child node types and disallowed child node types options for the whole node type to limit creation of immediate children for certain node types. The creation of collections during runtime should be removed to ensure the content repository handles it on creation/modification instead.

For Neos 1.0 we need the structure as well as the type and maybe the possibility to set some overriding properties for these. Rest is nice to have.

* TYPO3.Neos should work without TYPO3.Neos.NodeTypes
* all node types which TYPO3.Neos depend on (i.e. which are hardcoded in the source code somewhere) should be in TYPO3.Neos, all others in TYPO3.Neos.NodeTypes.
* All node types in TYPO3.Neos should be either *abstract* (meant to be extended) or *final* (not allowed to be extended). This means the average user does not have to deal with these node types.

    ""An error occurred while trying to call TYPO3\Neos\Controller\Frontend\NodeController->showAction(). Error for node: Could not convert array to Node object because the node ""/sites/myDemoSite/Home"" does not exist.

However when I just connected to front end site seemed OK.

I had a look in the database (nodedata) and found that in fact there were 2 ""Home"" nodes of type Typo3.Neos:Pages
One marked as removed in what must have been a draft non published workspace. Once I deleted this everything worked again but back to my original flat layout.

So then I tried the following with all but one page Published.
Home
    Some New Page
    New Page (not published)
Who We Are
Appointments

I then purposefully deleted the Home Node/Page. Got the same behaviour as above. but when I looked in the database it looked as if

""Home"" was duplicated and marked as deleted. ""New Page"" was marked as deleted but ""Some New Page"" did not exist.

Anyway it seemsto be a problem when you delete the sites homepage on purpose or not

I hope my explanation isn't too long winded!

h2. Motivation

The current page tree in Neos does do it's job, but for having a solid API and to make sure maintenance will be doable we need an ember based component

h2. Goal

The navigation component should be an extensible tree which could become Neos API and is usable for different types of nodes, like pages, news messages or any other kind of nodes. Depending on the node type it should be possible to do grouping in the tree (like 'group all news by year / month)

h2. Motivation

Neos should be more extensible in the long run, like for example add the possibility to load extra javascript components.

h2. Goal

Add a first conditional loading based on simple feature switches so we, as Neos team, can define that certain features are not fully stable yet, but can be enabled by setting a feature switch. Besides that it will make it possible to load other assets, but this will not be public API on first release as it's not defined well enough how this should work. But at least it should enable us to start building features like for example localization in 3rd party packages which can be merged into master later on.

h2. Deliverables

* A configurable loading process enabling the loading of sources from 3rd party packages
* Add feature switches
* Fix stability issues found along the way

Possible discussions:

    Should we provide default functionality in TYPO3.Neos or have a proof-of-concept in the demo package?
    Should we use configuration in Settings.yaml, node type configuration or meta data from the file system for configuration of templates/layouts?
    Should we provide a custom editor for the selection of image enriched values?
    How much of this is necessary for Neos 1.0?

Conclusion:

We concluded to continue with the current direction and implement a proof-of-concept. The implementation should go into TYPO3.Neos, but it should be possible to exclude this feature if not needed. The definition of available layouts should be defined by setting them in the TYPO3.Neos:Page node type configuration. The actual rendering should then use TypoScript to change the template or use a specific TypoScript object, this would be up to the implementor. We will need a slide operator to be able to get the nearest set parent value. The enriched editor is not necessary for the first part and should be a more generic selector editor with image thumbnails. A basic implementation should go into Neos 1.0."

2. Merge functions with similar functionality

If you look at the list of ""lookup"" interactions below you can see that we do similar jobs multiple times. I would suggest following changes:

* Replace Workspace arguments by ContextInterface arguments (and provide some easy way to retrieve a context from a workspace if we see the need for it). This will also render arguments like ""$includeRemovedNodes"" obsolete.

* The service should only return NULL, NodeInterface or QueryResultInterface<NodeInterface> if possible (Until we rewrote the queries to use DQL we could create a NodeQueryResult that implements a subset of the QueryResultInterface)

3. Extend the Neos ""Node REST API"" so that it provides common operations (using the NodeRepository)

* Target Audience: all users of Neos
* Responsible: ""Rens Admiraal (click to contact)"":http://forge.typo3.org/users/3198
* Implemented by: Rens Admiraal, Henjo Hoeksma
* Amount: 10 work days
* Version: 1.1
* Planned Implementation Timeframe: November till December

h2. Motivation

Full localization support is planned for Neos 1.1. To prepare a smooth integration within time limits the already prepared technical concept should be implemented.

h2. Goal

Prepare Neos from the technical perspective so creating the UX concept is easier (because we can toy with the technical concept in practice) as a preparation on full localization support in Neos.


h2. Deliverables

* Localized nodes in TYPO3CR
* Localization fallback chain
* Relations between translated nodes and the original translation
* *could have* a basic user interface for managing relations between translations
* *won't have* the full localization UX concept as this still has to be defined

This already allows the integrator to hide modules from certain roles. But the current implementation lacks some features:
