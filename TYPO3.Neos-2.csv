All following changes are presents in the attachement files.

I created new Aloha plugin include in a new Neos package :
	- Packages/Application/AlohaPlugin.ExtraFormats/Resources/Public/AlohaExtraFormatsPlugin/lib/extra-formats-plugin.js
His role is to get the original Format plugin and adding new styles in it.
Each styles is associated with a class attribute, which is define in a .css file associated with the plugin.
I decided to create my plugin in external package to reduce the impact in Neos core, because you can adapt the plugin
for your needs.

To add the new formats, I needed to add some feature not fully implemented.
I implement the ""addButton"" function in this two files :
	- Packages/Application/TYPO3.Neos/Resources/Public/JavaScript/LibraryExtensions/UiAlohaPlugin/multiSplit.js
	- Packages/Application/TYPO3.Neos/Resources/Public/Library/aloha/aloha.js

I needed to load my Aloha plugin dynamically. I implement this feature in the aloha configuration and in yaml configuration :
	- Packages/Application/TYPO3.Neos/Resources/Public/JavaScript/aloha.js
	- Packages/Application/TYPO3.Neos.NodeTypes/Configuration/NodeTypes.yaml
With this feature you can add new Aloha plugins dynamically for specific nodes.
The yaml configuration is only there as example, you can implement every Aloha plugins you need."

having a PluginView ""SimpleBasket"" wich calls BasketController::simpleAction().
Another PluginView ""ExtendedBasket"" calls BasketController::indexAction().

BasketController->simpleAction() should be available on any page. so i query its pluginView by ts and push it into the page.

so i do:
page = Page {
	parts{
		simpleBasket = PIPEU.Site:SimpleBasket{
			node = ${q(site).find('simplebasket').children('main').filter('[instanceof TYPO3.Neos:PluginView]').first()}
		}
	}
}

page template:
{parts.simpleBasket->f:format->raw()}
{content.main->f:format.raw()}

The template of BasketController->simpleAction:
<p>You have currently X items in your <f:link.action action=""index"">basket</f:link.action></p>

Viewing the frontendpage wich holds the pluginView of simpleBasket (basket/simplebasket.html) i have the pluginView twice on the page wich is correct.
1. the existing as node coming from children('main')
2. the second one added by {parts.simpleBasket->f:format.raw()}

The link action of the template produces two different links:

#1 - the node version: basket.html?--pipeu_site-basket[%40package]=pipeu.site
So this is the link to the page with the pluginView for BasketController::indexAction(). Correct!

#2 - the ts version: basket/simplebasket.html?--typo3_neos_nodetypes-page[%40package]=pipeu.site
This is always a link to the current page. Just switching simpleBasket ts from simpleAction to indexAction.

Why does the same PluginView produces different links?

i've discovered a problem with the f:form.select tag, if you use it within a backend module (fresh install of Neos 1.0.1). Because whenever you click on the generated dropdown, the left menu slides in. This is kind of annoying, because in my case the menu slides over the select element.
You can still click the options though.

As i am not particularly pro in javascript i could not find the bug myself, but i think that select elements in the backend are a common usecase, so i this is a ""should have"" bug.

Hi alex,
thanks for this nice tutorial.
I found a small problem at the end of you article.
<f:translate key=""error.{field.propertyName}.{field.errorCode}"" ... This will only work if your property is lowercase only. If you use lower-camelcase like myTestProperty it won?t work because you will have to convert it to my_test_property. Did you have any solution for this?

Thanks

The error messages consist of cryptic messages and backtraces. Here is an example

<pre>
Exception while rendering
page<TYPO3.Neos:Page>/
body<TYPO3.TypoScript:Template>/
content/
main<TYPO3.Neos:ContentCollection>/
itemRenderer<TYPO3.Neos:ContentCase>/

The TypoScript object at path ""page/body/content/main/itemRenderer/default/element"" could not be rendered: Missing implementation class name for ""Scriptme:Article"". Add @class in your TypoScript configuration. (20131222080619db2270)
</pre> 

What does that even mean? The ""@class"" is barely mentioned in any of the documentation and this error doesn't make sense whatsoever. I just created a custom element with a handful of properties. Why would I need to define the class for it. There is no special logic involved. (I followed the documentation on creating your own content elements.)

Please try to give meaningful feedback. With this I neither know what is wrong (as it makes no sense and worked in 1.0.0) nor what I should do to solve it because the suggested solution doesn't make sense either.

This is just an example. In many other cases, the user only get's the backtrace with a general message that sounds a little like ""something something very wrong. much error. something something"".

I stepped through the source code and debugged it a bit and the reason for the problem I think is the @var Annotation  of the followng properties in the class \TYPO3\Neos\Domain\Service\TypoScriptService

* $prependTypoScriptIncludes
* $appendTypoScriptIncludes


@var array in the format array('resources://MyVendor.MyPackageKey/Private/TypoScript/Root.ts2', 'resources://SomeVendor.OtherPackage/Private/TypoScript/Root.ts2')



While compiling Flow calls the method expandType(...) in TYPO3\Flow\Reflection\ReflectionService to suggest the correct type of the @var annotation:

<pre>
...
// we try to find the class relative to the current namespace...
$possibleFullyQualifiedClassName = sprintf('%s\\%s', $class->getNamespaceName(), $type);
if (class_exists($possibleFullyQualifiedClassName)) {
    return $possibleFullyQualifiedClassName;
}
...
</pre>

For the properties $possibleFullyQualifiedClassName has e.g. the value _\TYPO3\Neos\Domain\Service\array in the format array('resources://MyVendor.MyPackageKey/Private/TypoScript/Root.ts2', 'resources://SomeVendor.OtherPackage/Private/TypoScript/Root.ts2')_ 

The call class_exists(..) for this value breaks the compiling process. 
Maybe the autoloader has a problem with the slashes  ?

After removing the comment on both annotations (leave only @var array ) everything works.







	$possibleFullyQualifiedClassName = sprintf('%s\\%s', $class->getNamespaceName(), $type);
		if (class_exists($possibleFullyQualifiedClassName)) {
			return $possibleFullyQualifiedClassName;
		}expandType"

I'd suggest following measures:

h3. Get rid of the UserPreference entity

* It is currently used for ""context.workspace"" and ""contentEditing.wireframeMode"" - both of which should not be in there

h3. Centralize the users workspace logic

There is already *UserService::getCurrentWorkspace()* that could do what currently *UserFactory::create()* does:

the rendering of internal links in text (new feature of alpha7) doesn't work with php 5.3.27 on my mac.

h2.General ideas (to be discussed!):

* Reduce nesting levels: If the content element contains a root element, modify it instead of adding an additional wrapping tag
* If we need to add a wrapping element, we could use non-existing elements prefixed with @neos-@ (e.g. @neos-contentelement@). This is better to distinguish for the user and it is less immersive because browsers (should) ignore unknown elements.
* only use @data-neos-@-prefixed attributes for consistency. They can be used in CSS selectors, too.
* No need to use underscores in attribute-names (e.g. @data-neosdatatype-_hidden@ as everything prefixed with @neos-@ should be considered ""private""
* Only add attributes for non-defaults (e.g. @data-neos-removed=""false""@ can be omitted)"

This needs a new TypoScript feature to allow properties on a @Case@ object that are not used as matchers and results in the following TS:

Maybe its a good advice for the template builder to introduce a rule like:
Always build a wrapper div after the body <div class=""myProject""> and prefix all your css with .myProject ...{}

First of all a hostname does not need to have a dot. This is a common use case in intranets where the DNS suffix is used while finding the IP, but the actual hostname does not contain additional parts:
@intranet[.my-company.com] -> http://intranet/@.

Second, the new TLDs allow longer domain names than five chars, e.g. @travel@ which is already included in the list of valid domain suffixes:
http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt

There are more limits that could be checked, e.g.
* 127 level limit
* 253 char limit total in text representation

*How to reproduce*
This can be reproduced by setting the setting TYPO3.Flow.security.session.inactivityTimeout very low and then login to the backend. Then wait for the inactivity timeout has been reached and trigger an AJAX call (e.g. open inspect tree). Then reload the page and login.

*The problem*
The reason for this problem is that the last request which finds out that session has expired is an ExtDirect call, so even though the last request is to the node controller, the intercepted request was the ExtDirect one, so that's where you'll be redirected after you gain access (login).

*Solution*
Check if the original request is a ExtDirect request and if so use the default redirect instead."

An idea would be to use localStorage; however this is not that easy to pass to the server like a Cookie is.

One solution would be to add the localStorage value to a hidden field in the login screen, making it available for the redirect.

Then the value should be stored in the user preferences or the flow session, so that the redirect would work when accessing /neos and already being logged in. This would mean that the redirect wouldn't necessarily go to the last visited page in the frontend when logged in, but the last visited page before logging in. We could possibly update the flow session / user preference when navigating pages and being logged in.

Another solution would be to make the redirect client based and use JavaScript to do the actual redirect combining the value of localStorage and the workspace name. This has the drawback of having to run JavaScript for the redirect and also the drawback of being unable to check whether a page exists or not before redirecting to it.

I think we should go with the first solution."
