When creating a new site during the setup Neos 1.0 alpha7, the page is created successfully but you can't add any content to the site. All buttons are grayed out.

There is a fix by creating an entirely new page. So, something seems to be broken.

You can see in the attached screenshots.

I run into some troubles trying to override a TYPO3.Form setting within my Site package Settings.yaml.
The load order of packages was wrong so that TYPO3.Form was loaded after my package and by that overriding my changes.

The cause of this problem was, that the new created site package depends on TPYO3.flow and not on TYPO3.Neos.

This bug is very easy to fix and a big pain to find."
