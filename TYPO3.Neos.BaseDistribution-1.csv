* integration_dev with own domain for fe access
* * building from the ""phoenix"" trunk  (using (svn externals) to FLOW3, TYPO3 5.0 and the Demopackage that we want to build up)


* integration with own domain for FE access
* * building from the latest/defined tag (using also tagged packages and not trunk of packages)

h2. Build Setups in Hudson:

1) phoenix-integration_dev_commit
* Quick build that is triggered by SVN commits. 
* build xml just checkout the packages and run the basic unit tests

2) phoenix-integration_dev_full
* triggered nightly
* build that builds from scratch (empty folder):
* build xml:
 * svn checkout of phoenix trunk
 * fill the contentrepository with a CR dump
 * system specific configurations (property file)
 * run unit tests
  * run integration unit tests and selenium tests

3) phoenix-integration_dev_tests and 4) phoenix-integration_tests
* triggered manual only running the selenium tests


4) phoenix-integration_full
* triggered manual (at en of sprint for instance)
* simelar to phoenix-interagtion_dev_full but 
  * as the first step it tags the relevant packages
  * it tags the phoenix and adjust svn externals to new tag
  * then it builds from tag





*Criteria:*
* phoenix-dev.typo3.org points to integration-dev
* phoenix.typo3.org points to integration
* Hudson shows the build projects
* build (phing) files are in svn and understandable
* some short system overview (physically) and some short explainations

h1. Current Rendering Process

Currently, *both* TypoScript and Fluid are involved in rendering. TypoScript controls the rendering while Fluid is just used to render the individual parts. Thus, TypoScript renders the content. The process is as follows:

# @TYPO3\TYPO3\Controller\Frontend\NodeController::show@ gets a node passed, and triggers @render@ on the view
# @TYPO3\TYPO3\View\TypoScriptView@ picks up:
## it asks the TyposcriptObjectFactory to get a typoscript object name based on the current node type.
## then it checks if the current TypoScript tree has a *top-level object* for the which matches the expected TypoScript object name
## if yes, this is used. If no, we instanciate a default one.
# TypoScript @Page@ object renders a @Template@ TypoScript object
## For that, it assigns the @presentationPropertyNames@ to the template, after wrapping them into a proxy object which evaluate *TS Processors*
## then, the @Node@ object is assigned to the template
## Then, the template is rendered (see below), and the result is possibly wrapped again.
# @TYPO3\TYPO3\TypoScript\Template@ is a Fluid TemplateView and renders the template.
## Especially important is the @\TYPO3\TYPO3\TypoScript\Section@ (inheriting from @TYPO3\TYPO3\TypoScript\ContentArray@ and @\TYPO3\TypoScript\AbstractContentArrayObject@), which creates TypoScript sub-objects for *every* sub node, by asking the @\TYPO3\TypoScript\ObjectFactory@ again. This is how recursion is handled.

h2. Drawbacks of the current rendering process

* very complex
* TypoScriptView is quite inflexible
* recursive rendering creates very many objects, but is not really extensible.

h1. Requirements for revamped rendering

* Nodes can appear multiple times on a page. The rendering must be able to distinguish between these cases.
* When rendering a nodePath, we need to be able to render it completely out-of-context. I.e. render just a single content element being part of a bigger page. This could look somehow like: .../somePage/someSection/text?typoscriptObjectPath=page.sections.someSection.text
** This is needed for Varnish, ESI, etc.
** Thus, the question is *how to address nodes and their rendering information without ambiguity*
* Make Fluid replaceable by other rendering system?? TODO
* TODO: TypoScript objects should be ONLY allowed on FOLDER nodes.
* Bonus: wouldn't it be cool to use TypoScript in combination with Fluid *outside* of Phoenix as well?

h1. Pros and Cons

* *Fluid Template*
** + easy to understand, easy to write
** - only replaceable in an all-or-nothing manner
** - not context dependent; so it is hard to implement things like ""in the right column, all images should be 500 px wide maximum""
* *TypoScript*: 
** + adjustable and overridable on a very fine-grained level through use of TypoScript paths
** + processors are a powerful way to fine-tune rendering.
** + presentationModel enables creating ""virtual nodes"" which are declared just through TypoScript.
** - hard to write
** - presentationModel is hard to grasp and adds a lot of boilerplate code

h1. New Rendering Process

* *central problem: Adressing.* How do we address stuff like ""render node X in context Y""? Y must be identified by a path.
* *central problem: collections.* How do we render a *collection of nodes*? Through an <f:for> loop? Or differently?

* TODO: continue here..."

* when clicking on the main module titles in the menu, the last-used submodule should be opened.
* we do not want a separate redirect for that
* there should be no side-effect across browser tabs (i.e. two tabs should not influence each other)
* the module overview can always be accessed through a special icon-link in the submenu (""tile-image"")

Technical Details:

* we give every browser window/tab an ID using window.name
* based on the browser window/tab and main module identifier, we store the last-visited module pages in local storage
* we intercept the main module links and replace them using JS"

Everything works fine, but I get this error message all day when surfing in front- or in backend:

I think this is the corresponding error in the log-File from apache:
[Wed Dec 12 13:29:27.655765 2012] [mpm_winnt:notice] [pid 1412:tid 248] AH00428: Parent: child process exited with status 3221225477 -- Restarting.

The strange thing is, that nothing crashes like it says, it works fine, I only have to click ""Programm schließen / Close program"" and the website resumes loading.
XAMPP Control Panel also says, that apache is still running...


I googled a bit and tried all of this solutions:

Set in httpd.conf:

TraceEnable off
EnableMMAP off
EnableSendfile Off

output_buffer to 5000000

<IfModule mpm_winnt.c>

ThreadStackSize 8388608
</IfModule>

AcceptFilter http none
<IfDefine AEX>
Win32DisableAcceptEx
</IfDefine>



...But nothing works.

Can someone help me?"
