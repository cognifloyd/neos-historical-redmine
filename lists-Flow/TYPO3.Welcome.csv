I've just installed the 2.0b1 in a VM and recognized that the javascript in the welcome package seems to be broken. The mootools core v1.2.2 seems to be buggy as it does not return the first h2 element via @element.getFirst()@ but the "".tab"" div itself, which results in non object error after @element.getFirst('h2)@. It also results in a broken layout, as the ""tab-*"" css classes are not correctly assigned so that the stylesheets in the Styles.css don't apply correctly.

Just replace the mootools library with the latest one and everthing seems to be fine again. I used the latest @mootools-core-1.4.5-full-compat-yc.js@ from the mootools website.

This is just cosmetical, I know, but normaly it's the first part of Flow every new user sees.

Regards,
Axel"
