So I thought of the following scenarios on how to improve this:

- build a generic package that provides a login form, a user model and the controller to login/logout the user
- just document the needed steps, copy-paste the needed code templates in case one needs it
- add this to the Kickstarter-Package

At the moment I prefer the last of the ideas as it would just help to quickly set-up the needed stuff in a new package - which then can easily be extended or modified for the specific use-case of that application.

Any veto on adding this to the Kickstarter? Any better ideas? Any inputs from the maintainer(s) on how to prepare that feature, stuff that shouldn't be forgotten?"

I downloaded Typo3 Flow 2.2 this week and followed the QuickStart guide step by step (http://docs.typo3.org/flow/TYPO3FlowDocumentation/Quickstart/Index.html).

However, after execute this command: 

./flow kickstart:actioncontroller --generate-actions --generate-related Acme.Demo CoffeeBean

I executed the following command:

./flow doctrine:update

And I received the following error:

""Property Acme\Demo\Domain\Model\CoffeeBean::$Persistence_Object_Identifier does not exist""

I manually added that property to the CoffeeBean model and that has solved this issue (I was able to do CRUD operations with that model) but I'm not sure if this is an expected manual change before execute ""doctrine:update"". Even if that property should be added manually, I guess will be useful include that step in the QuickStart steps for newbies like me.

By the way, I like a lot the design of this framework, good job!

Thank you!
