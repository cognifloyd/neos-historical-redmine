The following info is incorrect about Symfony:

* It has a package repository (http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/) which is also accessible as a PEAR channel from the command-line tool
* Dependency Injection is coming in Symfony 2.0, and the code has been released to the community already.
* Symfony is developed using Continuous Integration (http://ci.symfony-project.org/)

My understanding is Symfony uses ""Persistence (Domain Model)"" not ""Persistence (Active Record)"".

I don't know what you mean by ""Object Lifecycle Management"" - I thought this was something PHP took care of internally :)

Finally, I have no idea what ""DDD Optimized Layer Architecture"" is - may be worth explaining?

I found your framework comparison (http://flow3.typo3.org/about/comparison/) quite interesting and have some input about eZ Components, where I think some entries are missing or maybe I just got it wrong.

I don't knwo what ""Package Repository"" exactly means, but I guess that is a PEAR channel, right? If so, eZ Components also have one at components.ez.no. ""l18 & l10n"" is supported Translation component (see http://ezcomponents.org/docs/tutorials/Translation). The ""Security Framework"" seems to be supported by multiple of the eZ Components: UserInput (http://ezcomponents.org/docs/tutorials/UserInput) is a component to secure any type of incoming data by properly validating and escaping it. The PersistentObject (http://ezcomponents.org/docs/tutorials/PersistentObject) component automatically prevents SQL incjections and the Template (http://ezcomponents.org/docs/tutorials/Template) components allows to avoid XSS by its XHTML-Context, which performs proper escaping on evrry output made. Or did I get the term ""Security Framework"" wrong? In addition, eZ Components make heavy use of DI in terms of their ""Tie-In"" components, which are used to create optional dependencies between components instead of making them hard-depend on each other. 

Most important: eZ Components are not realeased under a proprietary license (and actually have never been), but under the ""New BSD License"" (see: http://ezcomponents.org/about).

Thanks in advance for updating! :)

Best regards,
Toby
