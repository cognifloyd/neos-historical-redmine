here I am pointing out that it be great to provide a graphic or accordeon slider
to visually explain some sample scenarios for using NEOS (i.e. my guess is it would be more interesting for tech evangelists, startups and new users vs. 6.x which is likely to be more interesting for firms that already use 4.5)
The reality is, Typo3 can not maintain both branches forever. Someday Typo3 ""7"" will no longer be the focus and NEOS should be where our energies flow to (in my case of conceptual nature as I am not a real programmer per se but rather a former tech journalist and sys admin.)

Look forward to your feedback. Thanks for listening.

this is my first issue suggestion on your fine Redmine System here and
I hope it is in the right place.

It would be a big help for users to know how to make the move
from Typo3 4.5 or 6.x to NEOS with pros and cons. This should not take more than a few hours for someone that knows both systems well.

Another suggestion is to create use cases for 6.x vs. NEOS
and finally to provide sample websites based on NEOS or to list well-known sites that plan to make the move.

Thanks for giving it some thought!

Copy (versionized from the UX page): 

The ultra-simple in-page editing makes editors center their attention on content. If you need to edit SEO data next to the content, Neos provides an inspector for that. If you need more, the inspector will be expandable to the full backend screen providing the user with all property options. That?s not enough? Create custom backend modules. And if even that's not enough, underlying Neos, we have Flow - a first-class web framework which will enable you to build web applications that can be integrated with any other system.

Neos will blend in seamlessly with your website so you as an editor don't have to re-think in order to edit your content.
It is our philosophy to reduce the amount of cognitive load to make editing content fun again.

*Idea and Reasoning*
Help people understand that Neos is somewhat the contrary to TYPO3 CMS in relation to the quantity of features you experience. You start small and build - where the contrary is often the case for clients looking at CMS.
