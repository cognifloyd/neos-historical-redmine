In case you're using an SUEXEC/FCGI PHP Version in Apache, SUEXEC wont pass FLOW3_CONTEXT to the fcgi script...
( Because the varible wasn't defined in ""Safe-Vars"" on SUEXEC compilation time. )
Since providers propably won't recompile SUEXEC with FLOW3_CONTEXT defined in ""Safe-Vars"", php won't receive the value SET with SetEnv in apache...

In this case i've found just 3 quick solutions to set the environment variable:

*Solution 1: In the FCGI Starter Script:*
It usually looks something like this:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
FLOW3_CONTEXT='Development'
export FLOW3_CONTEXT
PHPRC=""/path/to/php5/conf/directory""
export PHPRC
PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN=5
export PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN
PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS=5000
export PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS
exec '/path/to/php5.3/bin/php-cgi'
</pre>

*Solution 2: Creating a prepend file in your php.ini*
Create a prepend file that looks like this:
<pre>
<?php
$_SERVER['FLOW3_CONTEXT']='Development';
?>
</pre>
Finally, set the ""auto_prepend_file = /path/to/your/prepend-file.php"" option in your php.ini

*Solution 3: Alter the Web/index.php file*
Add the following line to the file after the ""define"" line:
<pre>
$_SERVER['FLOW3_CONTEXT']='Development';
</pre>


There might be other ways to set the environment variable, but this should be mentioned in the documentation."
